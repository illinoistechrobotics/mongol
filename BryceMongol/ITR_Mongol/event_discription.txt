Command Structure
 
U,command,index,value,check\n
i.e. command = 0x80, index = 15 value = 127
U,80,F,7F,E


ROBOT_EVENT_CMD_NOOP		sent to robot every 100ms(10Hz)   
							index 0 value 0
							sent to computer every 1sec(1Hz)
							index 0 value 0

ROBOT_EVENT_CMD_START		sent to robot everytime the start button on gui is pressed
							index 0 value 0

ROBOT_EVENT_CMD_STOP		sent to robot everytime the stop button on gui is pressed
							index 0 value 0
							
ROBOT_EVENT_CMD_REBOOT		not sent in general but on robot side if sent the arduino 
							will do a reset through the watchdog timer only in using 
							an uno or the uno bootloader
							index 0 value 0 

ROBOT_EVENT_CMD_SHUTDOWN	not sent out but is placed on computer queue when the exit 
							is pressed and to leave the program. If recieved on robot 
							the arduino program will exit(0);
							index 0 value 0

ROBOT_EVENT_NET				not used

ROBOT_EVENT_NET_STATUS_OK   not used

ROBOT_EVENT_NET_STATUS_ERR	placed on computer queue every 1sec that there is no signal from arduino. 
							Can mean that there is no xbee plugged in or the robot is out of range or 
							the arduino crashed. In general this is place on computer queue if there 
							is no 1sec noop command comming to computer from arduino
							index 0 value 0

ROBOT_EVENT_NET_STATUS_NOTICE not used

ROBOT_EVENT_JOY_AXIS		places on the computer queue updated axis values from the joystick. 
							Only place if there is a change from last axis movement. Also to not 
							overfill the queue if there is a joy_axis event with the same index the 
							new value will be updated. 
							index axis number (0,1,2,3) value (0-255) 0 max down/left 255 max up/right 127 nuetral 
							
ROBOT_EVENT_JOY_BUTTON		places on the computer queue updated button vlaues from the joystick.
							index button number-1 (i.e index->0 is button 1 on joystick) value 0 released or up possition 1 pressed or down position
							
ROBOT_EVENT_JOY_HAT			places on the computer queue updated d-pad button presess 
							index 0  value 0 in nuetral position(nothing pressed) 1-8 (1 starting a 9 o'clock position and moving clockwise) 
							
ROBOT_EVENT_JOY_STATUS		places on the computer queue a warning that the joystick was unpluged
							index 0 value 0
					
ROBOT_EVENT_TIMER			places on the computer queue a timer event 
							10 hz timer index 0 value 0
							1 hz timer  index 0 value 1
							on robot side timer are called directly from the timer functions instead of being placed on queue
